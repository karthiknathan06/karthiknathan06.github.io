                <h3>Understanding Bloom Filters</h1>
                <p>
                    When dealing with large datasets, optimizing memory usage
                    and query performance is crucial. A
                    <strong>Bloom filter</strong> is a space-efficient
                    probabilistic data structure designed for scenarios where
                    memory is limited, and you need to quickly determine if an
                    element is present or not.
                </p>

                <h3>What is a Bloom Filter?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A Bloom filter is a data structure that allows you to
                        test whether an element is in a set with a small
                        probability of false positives (It may result
                        non-existing elements as present, but won't return
                        existing elements as not present).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It operates by using multiple hash functions to map an
                        element to several positions in a bit array.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If all the bits at these positions are set to
                        <code>1</code>, the element is considered to be in the
                        set; if any of the bits are <code>0</code>, the element
                        is definitely not in the set.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <div class="note">
                    <strong>Note:</strong> Deletion is not possible in a Bloom
                    filter since it stores only the hash, not the actual data.
                    Unsetting bits can remove other entries as well.
                </div>

                <h3>How a Bloom Filter Works</h3>
                <h4>
                    Simple Implementation: <a href="https://github.com/karthiknathan06/Bloomfilter/blob/main/main.py"><i>bloom_filter.py</i></a>
                </h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Initialization:</strong> A bit array of a fixed
                        size is initialized, with all bits set to
                        <code>0</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Adding Elements:</strong> When adding an
                        element, it is passed through multiple hash functions,
                        each producing an index corresponding to a position in
                        the bit array. The bits at these positions are set to
                        <code>1</code>. Here, the input gets passed through 3
                        hash functions and returns 3 indices, where bits are set
                        to 1.

                            alt="Insert text2"
                            width="400"
                        />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Checking Membership:</strong> To check if an
                        element is in the set, it is hashed again using the same
                        hash functions. If all the bits at the corresponding
                        positions are <code>1</code>, the element might be in
                        the set; if any bit is <code>0</code>, the element is
                        definitely not in the set.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>False Positives:</strong> Bloom filters can
                        return false positives, where the filter indicates that
                        an element is in the set when it’s not. However, they
                        never return false negatives. Here, even though Africa
                        is not in the set, and the indices returned by hash
                        functions are already set, it returns True, which is a
                        false positive case.

                            src="assets/explain4.png"
                            alt="Search NA text"
                            width="400"
                        />
                        <p>
                            These false positives could be reduced by using
                            proper hash functions, increasing the bucket size,
                            increasing the hash functions, and so on.

                    <li>When deletion is required.</li>
                    <li>When space efficiency is not a concern.</li>

                                space-efficient. It doesn’t store the actual
                                elements, only a compressed representation.

                                the number of elements. Memory usage increases
                                due to collision handling and storage of actual
                                data.

                <h3>How Bloom Filters Are Used in Apache Cassandra</h3>
                <p>
                    Apache Cassandra, a distributed NoSQL database, uses Bloom
                    filters to optimize read performance. In Cassandra, data is
                    stored in tables, and when a query is executed, it needs to
                    search through multiple SSTables (Sorted String Tables) to
                    find the relevant data.
                </p>

                <h4>Reducing Disk I/O</h4>
                <p>
                    Cassandra creates a Bloom filter for each SSTable. When a
                    query is executed, instead of scanning all SSTables on disk,
                    Cassandra first checks the Bloom filter to see if the
                    SSTable might contain the requested data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the Bloom filter indicates that the data might be in the
                    SSTable, only then does Cassandra perform a disk read. If
                    the Bloom filter indicates that the data is not in the
                    SSTable, the disk read is avoided entirely.
                </p>

                <h4>Improving Query Performance</h4>
                <p>
                    By using Bloom filters, Cassandra minimizes unnecessary disk
                    reads, which are time-consuming. This significantly improves
                    query performance, especially in large datasets where
                    multiple SSTables might be involved.
                </p>

                <h4>Managing Large Datasets</h4>
                <p>
                    Cassandra often deals with massive datasets that are
                    distributed across multiple nodes. Bloom filters help
                    efficiently manage these datasets by quickly ruling out
                    irrelevant SSTables, ensuring that only the necessary data
                    is accessed.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Bloom filters are a powerful tool for optimizing memory
                    usage and speeding up membership checks in large datasets.
                    Compared to hash maps, Bloom filters are more
                    space-efficient and faster in scenarios where only
                    membership testing is required. Understanding and utilizing
                    Bloom filters can lead to significant performance gains in
                    systems handling vast amounts of data.
